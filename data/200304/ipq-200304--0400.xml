          Interpellation 2003/04:400 av Gustav Fridolin (mp) till statsrådet
          Barbro Holmberg om EU:s asylprocedurdirektiv samt skyddsgrundsdirektivet
        </IPQ_title>

        <p xml:id="i-4gKr6DEdwYwbfSuZrPrSrg">
          EU har under en längre tid sökt enas om två direktiv rörande
          unionens hantering av asylsökande, dels direktivet om "miniminormer
          för medlemsstaternas förfaranden för att bevilja eller återkalla
          flyktingstatus" (känt som asylprocedurdirektivet) och dels direktivet
          om "miniminormer för när tredjelandsmedborgare och statslösa personer
          ska betraktas som flyktingar eller som personer som av andra skäl
          behöver internationellt skydd samt om dessa personers rättsliga
          ställning" (skyddsgrundsdirektivet). Båda direktiven, men främst
          asylprocedurdirektivet, har flera gånger blivit hårt kritiserade
          av olika aktörer på asylområdet. FN:s flyktingorgan UNHCR kritiserade
          redan i november förra året direktiven och ifrågasatte dess förenlighet
          med internationell rätt. Grundsatserna i kritiken var en rädsla
          för att de föreslagna direktiven skulle skapa en erosion i hela
          det globala asylsystemet och att framtida flyktingars liv sattes
          i fara. Inför ministerrådet den 30 mars ställdes frågan till statsrådet
          Barbro Holmberg om hon gjorde bedömningen att UNHCR:s kritik kvarstod
          inför detta möte. Svaret var undvikande och det är troligt att
          nämnden fick intrycket av att statsrådets bedömning var att man
          i huvudsak rättat till de brister UNHCR pekat på.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="i-U6FA85WAcprThq68ewXmTu">
          Det kom dock att visa sig att så inte var fallet. I ett uttalande
          inför ministerrådet den 30 mars upprepade och förstärkte FN:s
          flyktingkommissarie Ruud Lubbers sin kritik (uttalandet hämtat
          från UNHCR:s hemsida på Internet bifogas). Dessutom tillskrev
          tio organisationer med bred erfarenhet på området, däribland Amnesty
          International, Caritas Europa, Human Rights Watch, Kyrkornas flyktingkommission,
          Internationella organisationen för homosexuellas rättigheter,
          Läkare utan Gränser och Rädda Barnen, rådet och kommissionen med
          önskan om att förkasta asylprocedurdirektivet (också detta brev
          bifogas, hämtat från Amnesty Internationals hemsida). Organisationerna
          skriver bland annat att man med bestörtning åser att huvuddelarna
          i asylprocedurdirektivet handlar om att utestänga asylsökande
          från möjligheten att över huvud taget få en asylprocedur. Frivilligorganisationerna
          pekar också på det faktum att miniminormer ofta inte blir golv
          för flyktingpolitiken, utan snarare tak där ingen har en humanare
          flyktingpolitik men några kryper under den gemensamma överenskommelsen.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="i-SqCksnvrewTfJ9HHtuoVFR">
          Enligt rapporteringen på Utrikesdepartementets hemsida kom rådet
          den 30 mars aldrig att fatta beslut om de berörda direktiven.
          Det innebär att det fortfarande finns möjlighet, och anledning,
          för Sverige och regeringen att i enlighet med den kritik som framförts
          från UNHCR och människorättsorganisationerna sätta stopp för direktiven.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="i-4s114e1Hk9u1GnST3hV725">

          Lubbers calls for EU asylum laws not to contravene international
          law
        </p>
        <p xml:id="i-BjW6objrHGGjnMdzRWgeoZ">
          UN High Commissioner for Refugees Ruud Lubbers on Monday expressed
          concerns about two key pieces of draft European Union legislation,
          warning that several provisions in the current drafts would fall
          short of accepted international legal standards. Lubbers said
          they could lead to an erosion of the global asylum system, jeopardizing
          the lives of future refugees.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="i-SPV5AitbxTwcTNRd1nxStM">
          The two draft directives @ the last in a series of five major
          pieces of legislation intended to harmonize EU asylum law @ will
          be discussed by EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Brussels
          on Tuesday. They are supposed to be finalized in time for the
          1 May enlargement of the European Union.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="i-U4e841HgKmSyAmEMsa7Qnu">
          "The numbers of asylum seekers coming into the EU have dropped
          sharply and are continuing to do so," Lubbers pointed out.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="i-HK1R9ULP4v7qN9DbdibmZb">
          "We can improve the management of asylum by focusing on better
          burden-sharing within the EU," he said. "Even more importantly,
          we can keep numbers down by investing greater effort and resources
          in the regions where refugees are coming from. We're already seeing
          some progress in that respect. There is no need to focus so single-mindedly
          on reducing standards and trying to deter or deny protection to
          as many people as possible."
        </p>
        <p xml:id="i-C9cpnjUjZHZmj55XGRUWsh">
          Lubbers sent a letter last week to the Irish Prime Minister,
          Bertie Ahern, current holder of the EU Presidency, with two detailed
          notes laying out UNHCR's main concerns: one on the draft Qualification
          Directive, which lays down the definition of who qualifies as
          a refugee and who qualifies for subsidiary protection (used for,
          among others, victims of war); and one on the draft Asylum Procedures
          Directive, which lays down how that decision is reached in the
          case of each individual.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="i-2paFwGL61rtUGFkosiZxcE">
          Lubbers initially raised UNHCR's concerns about the direction
          the Procedures Directive was heading in a statement last November.*
        </p>
        <p xml:id="i-Bkn12HSwi6y5pMJ9UiscQd">
          In its note, UNHCR lays out a range of concerns including the
          proposed application of the so-called "safe third country" concept
          under which asylum seekers may be sent back to another country
          designated as "safe." The agency criticized a "sweeping exemption"
          that would deny certain asylum seekers access to a procedure altogether,
          disregarding the possibility that a country generally considered
          safe "might nonetheless not be safe for particular individuals."
          This would thereby create a real danger of indirect refoulement
          [forced return] of refugees to possible persecution in their home
          country "in contravention of the 1951 Convention and other international
          human rights law instruments."
        </p>
        <p xml:id="i-5f6b8J6ugkCfcEKNGdjBLu">
          Connected to this, UNHCR said the criteria for determining the
          "safety" of a third country are "minimalist" and could lead to
          asylum seekers being sent back to countries that do not maintain
          basic human rights standards and where there is no guarantee their
          cases would be fairly and efficiently examined. This "could amount
          to an effective denial of the right to seek asylum under international
          law," UNHCR said.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="i-9gSZcdifo89S4AjmbPCStd">
          UNHCR also said that draft Articles relating to appeals could
          also lead to violations of international law. As the text stands,
          "the vast majority" of rejected asylum seekers who lodge an appeal
          will not be permitted to remain in the EU until their appeals
          are decided @ despite the fact that in several European countries
          30-60 percent of initial negative decisions are subsequently overturned
          on appeal.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="i-MgBTRvsYHg8358iRgQkuCh">
          The text contains a list of wide-ranging exceptions to the principle
          that people should be allowed to remain while their appeals are
          being considered @ exceptions "which have no relation to the merits
          of a person's claim, but are based on technical or discretionary
          factors, or the claimant's behaviour." UNHCR's note said. "For
          example, persons may be removed pending appeal simply because
          they have been detained, or because they failed to make an application
          earlier. Such rules can badly prejudice refugees who are traumatized,
          confused or simply not properly informed about the asylum process."
        </p>
        <p xml:id="i-SyeXsw7wM48fsNkRuquoCw">
          "The cumulative effect of these proposed measures is that the
          EU will greatly increase the chances of real refugees being forced
          back to their home countries," Lubbers said on Monday. "It will
          be hard to track, because the forced return may take place via
          a chain of countries, but that does not mean it will not happen.
          Even a single person being sent back to the risk of torture is
          one too many."
        </p>
        <p xml:id="i-YcBTM4Zq5i5rHggPK2qTF9">
          UNHCR also raised a number of major concerns about the current
          draft of the Qualification Directive, including the proposals
          to severely limit the scope of what constitutes "serious harm"
          (and therefore who qualifies as a beneficiary of international
          protection). These could lead to people fleeing a war zone being
          rejected from all forms of international protection.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="i-U1N3NQMWEgzQT68AjDPthh">
          Lubbers said that some EU States seemed intent on forcing their
          own most restrictive and controversial practices on to the books
          of all 25 future members of the EU. "In some cases," he said on
          Monday, "these practices have not even been passed into their
          own national legislation, or are under domestic legal challenge,
          yet they are pushing them at the EU level."
        </p>
        <p xml:id="i-NEiTG65h7f4KmPPo8bxrKC">
          Lubbers also said if the EU adopted the Directives in their current
          form it would set a negative precedent for other parts of the
          world, where they would be perceived as an effort to shift the
          burden back to developing countries which already host the great
          majority of the world's refugees. "This could have a knock-on
          effect that might weaken the protection of refugees all across
          the world," he said. "Other countries will look at the EU and
          say 'If they can do this, so can we.'
        </p>
        <p xml:id="i-3QeAvpSxJyKKQp7fviDMvc">
          "We need to remember the original intentions of the harmonization
          process, which was to produce a common European asylum system,
          based @ and here I quote the Tampere Conclusions @ 'on the absolute
          respect for the right to seek asylum' and the 'full and inclusive
          application' of the 1951 UN Refugee Convention. We need to revive
          that spirit.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="i-6X7tLSEUTaaBiQn8NQA3cm">
          "Europe should be proud of its tradition of giving asylum, of
          saving lives," Lubbers added. "The numbers of asylum seekers are
          going down. We're working hard to find solutions and improve conditions
          in regions of origin, and we are seeing the successes of that
          humane policy and its effect on the numbers moving onwards. It
          would be a real pity if Europe, at this point, were to undermine
          the great tradition of protecting real refugees."

        <p xml:id="i-JSkmJUBP3AJ5SNyoVtkYgF">
          Dear Mr Vitorino,
        </p>
        <p xml:id="i-PTKAjG9ByAu7QTFr8WvtvD">
          As you are aware, the European Council on Refugees and Exiles*
          and the undersigning organisations have closely followed the negotiations
          on the Commission's proposal for a Council Directive on minimum
          standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing
          refugee status throughout the last four years. We have regarded
          this initiative as a key element of European Union attempts to
          set minimum standards for asylum legislation in accordance with
          the Amsterdam Treaty. We have also appreciated the Commission's
          extensive efforts to facilitate an agreement between Member States,
          amid disparate and often inflexible national positions.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="i-TRgnANq1Qvi477LgmyAXGB">
          We are aware that negotiations have not been finalised yet. However,
          in the last stage of this lengthy negotiation process, we note
          that the gaps between this draft Directive and international law
          have grown even wider and that the recommendations repeatedly
          issued by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr
          Ruud Lubbers, and by civil society organisations have not been
          duly taken into account. We note with deep regret that the most
          contentious provisions are all intended to deny asylum seekers
          access to asylum procedures and to facilitate their transfer to
          countries outside the EU. We are concerned about the effect that
          this abdication from international law obligations will have on
          refugee protection within the EU and elsewhere, as well as on
          the EU's credibility in the international refugee and human rights
          debate. We are now unable

          to further regard this initiative as credible and therefore,
          we are compelled to call on you to withdraw this proposal, as
          it remains in breach of the EU's own commitments as set out in
          the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is to become part of
          the EU Constitution, as well as individual Member States' responsibilities
          under international refugee and human rights law.

          This joint letter intends to highlight the main (but not exclusive)
          concerns of our organisations regarding provisions on safe countries
          of origin, safe third countries (including 'super safe third countries'),
          and the appeal system. While the scope of the letter is restricted
          to these key issues, our organisations also deplore the fact that
          the Directive will mostly be reduced to a catalogue of optional
          provisions, leaving critical issues such as detention and the
          right to legal assistance to Member States' discretion.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="i-BckBrNXXg8btdu7QZqXksh">
          The current proposal foresees the possibility of using the safe
          country of origin concept to restrict access to the regular asylum
          procedure. While the individual may rebut the presumption of safety,
          s/he may be required to do so in an accelerated procedure with
          only limited safeguards and with the burden of proof lying exclusively
          with him/her. Furthermore, the proposal foresees a common list
          of safe countries of origin binding on all Member States, as a
          result of which, Member States will be forced to use this concept.
          In light of recent practice in some Member States, we are very
          concerned that the safe country of origin concept may be implemented
          by Members States in a way which amounts to discrimination among
          refugees in violation of Article 3 of the 1951 Refugee Convention,
          Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European
          Union and Article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and

          We are also concerned about the use of the safe third country
          concept in the proposal, which does not conform with Member States'
          obligations under international law. The proposal allows Member
          States to shift responsibility to third countries, regardless
          of whether the applicant has meaningful links with such countries
          and whether durable solutions exist there, including protection
          against refoulement as established by international law and access
          to a fair and efficient asylum procedure resulting in the recognition
          of refugee status. Under international refugee law, the primary
          responsibility for international protection remains with the State
          where the asylum claim is lodged. A transfer of such responsibility
          can only be envisaged where a meaningful link exists between an
          asylum applicant and a third country which makes a transfer reasonable
          and where the third country is determined safe in the individual
          circumstances of the applicant. Moreover, a transfer can only
          take place if the third State gives its consent to admit or readmit
          the asylum applicant and to provide him/her with full access to
          a fair and efficient determination procedure. The burden of proof
          regarding the safety of the third country for the particular applicant
          lies entirely with the country of asylum and the presumption of
          safety must be rebuttable by the applicant. The proposal in its
          current form, however, does not guarantee sufficiently the right
          of the asylum applicant to rebut the presumption of safety, as
          it may even allow Member States to reject the claim without considering
          the particular circumstances of the applicant, and does not contain
          sufficiently strict criteria for the designation of countries
          as safe.
        </p>
        <p xml:id="i-3P2Wy4PM9uJqMb1RoVSVSZ">
          Furthermore, we are particularly concerned by the exceptional
          application of the safe third country concept to countries in
          the European region, as it appears in the proposal. No country
          can be labelled as a safe third country for all asylum seekers;
          a decision on a country's safety for a particular applicant must
          always be the outcome of an individual examination of the claim,
          as opposed to a general presumption based on country-related criteria.
          The exceptional application of the safe third country concept,
          however, allows Member States to deny access to the procedure
          to all asylum seekers "illegally" arriving from designated countries
          in the European region and strips them of any rights to rebut
          this presumption. Hence, under the current proposal, a border
          guard without knowledge of international refugee law or national
          asylum provisions could be given the sole power to decide on the
          removal of an asylum applicant to a country even before the competent
          authority has had the chance to look into the claim. In practice,
          this would leave the decision-making authority outside any legal
          framework of accountability for their decisions and could result
          in a serious risk that Member States may violate their international
          obligations to guarantee an effective remedy and to protect against
          refoulement, as enshrined in Article 33 of the 1951 Refugee Convention;
          Articles 3 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights;
          Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture; Article 7 of the
          International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; and Articles
          18, 19 and 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European
          Union. Given that the proposal does not require that Member States
          obtain agreement from countries under the exceptional application
          of the safe third country concept to process the asylum claim
          before removing the applicant, the implementation of such a concept
          may lead to refugees-in-orbit situations, and to chain-refoulement,
          which are in breach of the European Convention of Human Rights,
          as it has been repeatedly confirmed by the jurisprudence developed
          by its Court .
        </p>
        <p xml:id="i-8QkBzqkGgUAJDC8RVqgojK">
          We also believe that the proposal does not contain adequate appeal
          safeguards for asylum seekers. The right to an effective remedy
          before a court or tribunal is embodied in EC law, in Article 47
          of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and
          in Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights. As held
          by the European Court of Human Rights, it implies the right to
          remain in the territory of the Member State until a final decision
          on the application has been taken. Thus, the right of asylum applicants
          to remain pending a final decision on their cases is essential
          for Member States to comply with their non-refoulement obligations
          and international law provisions related to the right to an effective
          remedy. The proposal, however, does not contain an explicit right
          of all asylum seekers to remain or request for leave to remain
          in the asylum country.

          In light of the above and as organisations committed to promoting
          international law and fundamental humanitarian values, we find
          the proposal on asylum procedures, in its current form, unacceptable
          as a legal basis for minimum standards in the European Union.
          Therefore, we are forced to call upon the Commission to withdraw
          its proposal for a Council Directive on minimum standards on procedures
          in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status.
